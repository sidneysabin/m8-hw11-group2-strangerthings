Addressing Commit Disparity and Committing to Main: 

Our team got confused about all the different push and pull requests, and everyone edited different code versions. For example, after a merge, Elodie was working on different versions of cast page and was behind on commits. Sabin was committing and was ahead of the main. And when Sabin and Laura would merge, there would be conflicts with the CSS, and older versions would appear. Therefore, Sabin committed to the main to reduce the confusion and had more commits than others because he wanted to ensure everything looked appealing. For example, Sabin changed all pictures on the cast page and the text. In addition, Sabin added episode descriptions on the episode page and character descriptions on the case page.
