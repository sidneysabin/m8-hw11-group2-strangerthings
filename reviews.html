            <p class="review-text">In short, Stranger Things has flaws — big, noticeable flaws. But those flaws somehow make the show stronger, not weaker. Even if the Duffers have nothing more interesting to say than, "We love '80s movies!" they convey their affection for said movies so enthusiastically that you can’t help but be swept up by the whole thing in the end.</p>

            <p class="review-text">It’s a series about growing up, about the confusion of childhood and the pain of leaving it all behind. The show seemed to forget that at some point during the last season, but season three has put things back on track again with episodes that pirouette between real horror, swashbuckling adventure and perfectly-pitched drama with astonishing ease.</p>
            <p class="review-text">Of course, fans expecting a season of tension, terrifying monsters and strange moments in the Upside Down will be more than satisfied with this season. One of its creepiest – and most successful – elements is how much of the horror happens above ground. For the first time in the show’s three seasons, it feels like the link between the Upside Down and Hawkins really is breaking down, with truly terrifying consequences. For the first time in Stranger Things it's the humans that are really terrifying, not the denizens of the upside down.
            <p class="review-text">The show’s writers, Matt and Ross Duffer, have hinted that the Stranger Things team has sketched out a story arc that will take the show to four or five seasons in total. In season two, the brothers misstepped by taking us away from Hawkins and back into El’s past, leaving behind the best thing about the entire show: the chemistry between the main cast. Season three makes up for that misstep in spades.</p>

            <p class="review-text">Stranger Things is fun for almost all the family, depending on your juvenile cohorts’ response to occasional gory scenes. The pace is (just about) fast enough to keep younger viewers hooked, and anyone old enough to remember 1983 for real is in for a richly enjoyable retro-feast whose cockle-warming abilities make up for (what is for us) a slightly predictable narrative and inadequate explanation of the underlying mythology by the end. All the necessary ingredients are here: spooky woods, walkie-talkies as the bleeding edge of technology, nosebleeds as a sign of violent mental effort, lost spirits communicating through mains electricity and crackling phonelines, elasticated walls through which desperate hands and screaming faces push, and plain friends doomed to bloody deaths in the furtherance of plot.</p>

            <p class="review-text">Stranger Things’ Season 4 ends with a strong, action-heavy conclusion and some of the most memorable scenes since Season 1. It gives series-best performance opportunities for Brown, Sink, and others, and the weaving of the disparate plotlines and locations is most successfully handled here. It’s a strong conclusion. On the other hand, there are still some bafflingly missed opportunities that blunt its emotional potential and tension. Nonetheless, it’s a fairly satisfying season ender that directly connects to what we can expect from Season 5, so there are plenty of opportunities to cash these in in the future.</p>
